## Goals and Learning Outcomes

- A fun way to learn about the power of DevTools
- Instant gratification from CSS rules that work EXACTLY as intended 
- Instant frustration management tool from CSS that have unintended consequences... 
- A skill set building project by experimentation and documentation reading
